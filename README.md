This project is designed by students to provide a smart solution for
        reducing waiting times and ensuring safety in college bus systems. We
        are a team of five students who came together with a common goal to
        solve everyday problems faced by students and parents in school and
        college transportation. Our project, Smart Bus Tracking System, combines
        AI, GPS, and IoT to make bus travel smarter, safer, and more reliable.
        With this system, students no longer need to wait for buses without
        knowing their location, and parents can feel reassured about their
        childâ€™s safety.
